#/r/DailyProgrammer Challenges

Just for fun! Here are some programs I wrote for some of the [/r/DailyProgrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) challenges.

These are really enjoyable and a great chance to explore different languages, so in the spirit of things I'll be trying to use a wide variety of
programming languages.

If you've never tried out /r/DailyProgrammer before, you've been missing out! :)
